auto-phrase-tokenfilter
=======================

Lucene Auto Phrase TokenFilter implementation


Performs "auto phrasing" on a token stream. Auto phrases refer to sequences of tokens that
are meant to describe a single thing and should be searched for as such. When these phrases
are detected in the token stream, a single token representing the phrase is emitted rather than
the individual tokens that make up the phrase. The filter supports overlapping phrases.

The Autophrasing filter can be combined with a synonym filter to handle cases in which prefix or
suffix terms in a phrase are synonymous with the phrase, but where other parts of the phrase are
not. This enables searching within the phrase to occur selectively, rather than randomly.

#Overview

Search engines work by 'inverse' mapping terms or 'tokens' to the documents that contain
them. Sometimes a single token uniquely describes a real-world entity or thing but in many
other cases multiple tokens are required.  The problem that this presents is that the same
tokens may be used in multiple entity descriptions - a many-to-many problem. When users
search for a specific concept or 'thing' they are often confused by the results because of
this type of ambiguity - search engines return documents that contain the words but not
necessarily the 'things' they are looking for. Doing a better job of mapping tokens (the 'units'
of a search index) to specific things or concepts will help to address this problem.
